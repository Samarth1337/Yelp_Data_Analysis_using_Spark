{"m1": 3, "m2": 2, "reason": "In this code, M1 is faster than M2. This is because M1 does not involve sorting within the Spark framework and utilizes Python's native sorting capabilities,  which are more suitable for smaller datasets like in this case. M2 uses sorting operations using sortBy and take which have their own additional overheads due to the distributed Spark framework. But it is inconsistent and will vary for different cases with varying dataset sizes."}
